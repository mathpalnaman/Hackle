# 🧠 Hackle – A Wordle-Inspired Game for Programmers

Hackle is a custom-built, Wordle-style guessing game designed specifically for developers and tech enthusiasts. Unlike the traditional Wordle, Hackle challenges users to guess computer science-related words. The game features an intuitive UI, keyboard input, word validation via FastAPI, and a clean, animated binary background for that authentic coder feel.
